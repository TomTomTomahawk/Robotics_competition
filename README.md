# Robotics competition
Arduino code (C) for Sorbonne University's robotics competition. The final code (not present here) allowed the acceleration of the robot as long as a distance target wasn't reached, as well as backward mobility. Sideways mobility couldn't be reached due to one of the components of our second-hand servo motors breaking and the fixed limited budget of the project.
